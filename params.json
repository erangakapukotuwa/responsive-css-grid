The smallest block, class name is `one-block`. And the next one is `two-block`. Other names are inclemently changing till the `twelve-block`. You can use different combination of these blocks to fill each rows as your prefer and the requirement. You will make a good sense after doing the following steps. Try it. It is quite simple. :)  \r\n\r\n### Available class names(Blocks)\r\n```sh\r\n<div class=\"block one-block\">\r\n<div class=\"block two-block\">\r\n<div class=\"block three-block\">\r\n<div class=\"block four-block\">\r\n...\r\n...\r\n<div class=\"block twelve-block\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\nInclude the `responsive-css-grid.css` file in the header part of your HTML page.\r\n```sh\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"parth/to/css-responsive-grid.css\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the html into the `body` section. \r\n```sh\r\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n\t<div class=\"row\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t\t......\r\n\t\t.....\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Please make sure that the total of the blocks need to be eaqual to twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Thats all. Let's see the code in discreptive view.\r\nOpen a `wrapper` class first. \r\n```sh\r\n<div class=\"wrapper\"></div>\r\n```\r\n> The default max-width(Maximum width) is 1200px. You can change this value or overwrite using css, if you want to change max > width of your site. And next,\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd a `row` class inside the `wrapper`\r\n```sh\r\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n\t<div class=\"row\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can add your preferred grid structure in to the `row`. The total of the blocks needs to be equal to twelve(12).  \r\n```sh\r\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n\t<div class=\"row\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t\t......\r\n\t\t.....\r\n\t\t<div class=\"block one-block\">Your content ...</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Enjoy it (y)**\r\n\r\n\r\n### License \r\nThis projected is licensed under the terms of the MIT license\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
